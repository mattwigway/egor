\title{Calculate EI-Index of ego networks}
\usage{
EI(object, alt.attr, include.ego = FALSE, ego.attr = alt.attr, rescale = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{An \code{egor} object.}

\item{alt.attr}{\code{Character} naming grouping variable.}

\item{include.ego}{\code{Logical}. Include or exclude ego from EI calculation.}

\item{ego.attr}{\code{Character}, naming the ego variable corresponding to \code{ego.attr}. Defaults to \code{ego.attr}.}

\item{rescale}{\code{Logical}. If \code{TRUE}, the EI index calculation is re-scaled,
so that the EI is not distorted by differing group sizes.}
}
\value{
Returns \code{tibble} with the following columns:
\itemize{
\item ego ID (".egoID")
\item network EI-Index ("ei")
\item subgroup EI-Index values (named by value levels of \code{alt.attr}/\code{ego.attr})
}
}
\description{
The EI-Index is the division of the surplus count intra-group edges over inter-group edges,
divided by total count of all edges.
This implementation uses the intra-group and inter-group density instead
of edge counts, when \code{rescale} is set to \code{TRUE} (default). The EI-Index is calculated for
the whole network and for subgroups. Alternatively, the EI index can be employed as a measurement
for egos tendency to homo-/heterophily - use \code{\link[=comp_ei]{comp_ei()}}.
for that variant of the EI-Index.
}
\details{
The
whole network EI is a metric indicating the tendency of a network to be
clustered by the categories of a given factor variable (\code{alt.attr}). The EI value of a
group describes the tendency of that group within a network to be connected
(if between 0 and 1) or not connected (if between -1 and 0)
to other groups. Differing group sizes can lead to a distortion of EI values
i.e. the ability of a big group A to form relationships to much smaller group B
is limited by the size of B. Even when all possible edges between A and B exist,
the EI value for group A might still be negative, classifying it as \emph{homophile}.
The \code{re-scaled} EI-Index values provided by this implementation substitutes absolute
edge counts by inter- and intra-group edge densities in order to avoid the
distortion of the EI-Index values. These values express the extend of homo- or heterophily
of the network and its subgroups, \emph{as made possible by subgroup sizes}.
